# Comparative-Analysis-for-Loan-Prediction
This repository contains a Loan Prediction System implemented using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to study and evaluate various Machine Learning models suitable for Loan Prediction using brute-force technique.

📁 Project Overview
The dataset used for this project includes various features such as:
Applicant's income
Credit history
Education level
Marital status
Loan amount
Property area
And more...
By training a classification model, this project aims to assist banks and financial institutions in automating loan eligibility decisions.
